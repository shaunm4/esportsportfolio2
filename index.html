    Dear Hiring Manager, <br><br>
    I am excited to apply for the Esports and Gaming role at your company. As someone passionate about esports and gaming, I have always been inspired by your company’s contribution to the gaming industry and its dedication to making immersive experiences for players on a global scale. With my background in lab and event management, combined with my enthusiasm for competitive and casual gaming culture, I am confident in my ability to contribute in a meaningful way to your team.
    In my previous experience as a community ambassador and treasurer, I acquired skills that are applicable to the esports and gaming industry. For instance:
    <ul>
        <li>Team Collaboration: Working on HBCU Esports and Gaming Week I collaborated with my fellow esports staff to give presentations and lab tours for 400 students during tight deadlines. This mirrors the team oriented and fast-paced nature of esports campaigns and events.</li>
        <li>Creativity and Innovation: Whether it was facilitating community tournaments or brainstorming topics for tours and events such as Science on the rocks in collaboration with Discovery Place, I consistently brought fresh ideas that were well received by audiences.</li>
    </ul>
    Beyond my professional experience, I am a consistent gamer who knows the nuances of community building and player engagement. My involvement in gaming communities has shown me the importance of creating memorable experiences and fostering connections, which are values I see reflected in your company’s mission. I am particularly drawn to this role because of the focus on competitive esports tournaments, and community engagement. Joining your team would give me the opportunity to combine my personal passion for gaming and professional expertise to drive impactful results.Thank you for considering my application. I would be glad to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs. <br><br>
    Please feel free to contact me at 704-853-4302 or shaunamoore2904@gmail.com. <br><br>
    I look forward to contributing to your company’s success and helping shape the future of esports and gaming. <br><br>

    Sincerely, <br>
